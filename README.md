Demo of alphaTPGMR method, compared against the original TP-GMR model. Given a set of demonstrations, a reproduction of the original demos is generated using alphaTPGMR and then TPGMR. Trajectories are then generated with both methods for a set of randomly generated task parameters to test generalisation capabilities.

It can be seen that this method provides significantly improved generalisation performance, compared against the original TPGMR method.
